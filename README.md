# Optimism Frame for Governance Accessibility

### Project Submitted By

@suede0619 @cotabe @_.sayonara

## Summary

**Develop Farcaster Frame as a scalable governance tool to connect token holders with delegates who share similar values.** Delegates answer a series of 'values' questions in a survey format. Token holders also respond to these questions and receive recommendations for delegates with aligned values.

## Why should we build this?

The project enhances the broader Ethereum ecosystem. When I receive an airdrop or hold governance tokens on a platform, I am invited to delegate my voting power, but I lack information about the values of the delegate options available. Currently, no such tool exists within the ecosystem, and it is likely to see widespread adoption.

This project will initially be launched to the Optimism community under the guidance of @cotabe, a Grant Specialist with General Magic. 

The project will apply for OP RetroPGF 6. The round is focused on governance. Applications for RetroPGF 6 will open in August 2024, with eligibility criteria expected to be established in the same month.

In exchange for funding the development of this project, grant proceeds will be shared between the team and the RaidGuild treasury. 

A portion of any grant proceeds will be allocated to @cotabe as a success fee.

The project provides exposure for RaidGuild to the Optimism community. RaidGuild logo included in MVP1 UI, and future UIs.

This trial introduces a new paradigm for funding through grants, and proceeds from grants, within the Guild and builds exposure to General Magic.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

In this RIP RaidGuild would seed fund the project for research, dev and design to build MVP1, plus groundwork and application for RetroFunding 6.

Using grant proceeds the project would repay RaidGuild for its seed funds, and split the remainder with the Guild according to this schedule:

- First $5200 to RaidGuild to cover seed.
- 7%-15% to Cotabe ($10K-$25K = 15%, $25K-$100K = 10%, >$100K = 7%).
- Remaining Funds: 50% to RaidGuild, 50% to Team.

## Risks

There is uncertainty around whether an OP RetroPGF grant will be received in Round 6 for the project, but if we qualify for the grant it will likely be decently substantial. We believe this idea is a good one and the MVP1 can be used to apply for funding elsewhere.
